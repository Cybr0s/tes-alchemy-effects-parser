    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project was created to enrich role-playing experience in The Elder Scrolls universe by managing the vast variety of alchemy reagents and their associated effects across different games of the series. The alchemy data for each game differs in terms of naming conventions, overlapping effects, and unique effects, making it difficult to standardize them for consistent use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool scrapes, parses, and cleans the alchemy data from the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Wiki Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page) website, organizing it into a unified format to aid fellow role-players and allow better immersion in the game's alchemy system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tool uses Python and standard libraries like `re` (for regex) and `collections.OrderedDict` to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "- No external libraries required besides `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`."

    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In The Elder Scrolls games, different titles (e.g., *The Elder Scrolls Online*, *Oblivion*, *Skyrim*, etc.) use various terms for the same magical effects, making the same alchemical reagent in different games have effects with the same meaning but different names.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in *Daggerfall*, the effect `Heal Health` is used, whereas in *Skyrim*, it is called `Restore Health`. Some effects, on the contrary, have overlapping names, resulting in the need to remove doubles. These inconsistencies| made it hard to create a unified list for role-playing purposes."

    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This project solved the problem by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scraping the alchemy data from the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Wiki Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page) website.\n",
    "2. Parsing the data to replace effect names in accordance with the naming convention (desinged beforehand).\n",
    "3. Cleaning and polishing the resulting dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, alchemy reagents and their effects are standardized across all the games, simplifying role-play and enhancing the immersive experience."
